University of Allahabad has always occupied an esteemed place among the Universities of India over a century. Established on 23rd September 1887, it is the fourth oldest University 
of India after Calcutta, Bombay and Madras University. The credit for conceiving a large Central College in Allahabad (now named as Prayagraj), eventually to develop into a University, goes to 
Sir William Muir, Lt. Governor of United Provinces. As a result of his initiative the foundation stone of the Muir Central College (named after him) was laid on Dec. 9 1873 by His Excellency 
Lord Northbrook. Sir William Muir said on the occasion; "The establishment of a central college at Allahabad (now named as Prayagraj) has been my earnest desire ever since I assumed 
my present office." Shortly after coming here I found that a strong wish prevailed among the chief people of the place for a better means of education at Allahabad (now named as Prayagraj); 
and being myself deeply impressed with the same conviction, I took occasion at the first Darbar which I held here  urge upon those present the necessity of showing that they were sincere 
and in earnest, by contributing to the work.

<h3>
The appeal was widely and liberally met, a considerable sum was subscribed and 
address was presented to me in 1869, praying for the establishment of the college 
here." On September 23, 1887 Act XVIII was passed which established the University
 of Allahabad. Like the Universities of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, the University 
of Allahabad also started as a degree conferring institution. Its first entrance 
examination was held in March 1889. In 1904 the Indian Universities Act was passed
 which limited the territorial jurisdiction of University of Allahabad to the 
United Provinces of Agra and Awadh, the Central Provinces including Berar, Ajmer,
 Mewar and most of the states of Rajputana and Central Indian Agencies. Between 1887
 and 1927 at least thirty-eight different institutions and colleges of this area were
 affiliated to University of Allahabad. With the promulgation of the University of 
Allahabad Act in 1921, the Muir Central College lost its independent existence. 
Between 1922-27 the University had its internal and external wings which were 
subsequently separated from the University to give the latter a purely unitary,
 and residential character. In fact the University of Allahabad was started with 
a preliminary loan of Rs. 5240/- from the government to meet its expenses. The 
loans were repaid in two years. Henceforth, its main source of its income was from 
the examination fees and sale of Prospectus & Calendar. Being an examining body it
 met its incidental expenses easily.

In 1892-93 the University began to invest some capital in the Government Securities.
 In 1899-1900 its reserve fund amounted to Rs. 34,000. The University was thus now
 in a position to construct its own buildings. In 1909 the present site was selected
 for the Library, the Senate House and the Law college. These buildings, which now
 house the Registrar's Office, Senate Hall and the English Department, were designed
 by Sir Swinton Jacob and their construction was approved in 1910. The foundation 
of the Senate House was laid on 17th January 1910 by Sir John Havett, the Chancellor.
 The construction of the Senate Hall, the Law College and the former Library building
 was commenced in 1910 and they were completed in 1915 at the cost of Rs. 11,67,275.



In 1923 the Government decided to acquire the property of the Indian Press for the 
University at the cost of about seven lakh rupees. This property comprised the 
present buildings of the Philosophy Department, the department of Med./Mod. History 
and the spacious buildings in which there was formerly the Proctor's Office, Post
 Office, and some rooms which are shared by the Political Science, Med./Mod. History,
 Ancient History and Hindi Departments. A few years ago this spacious building was
 demolished. The Indian Press property also included a tiled roofed building behind 
the dramatic hall and a similar type of building near the Political Science 
department and another building near the English Department. Of these the first
 two exist in present, the third was demolished recently. Since 1911 many new 
buildings have sprung up in the Senate House Campus and in the Chathem Lines campus.
 In the senate House Campus the Union Hall, the old Guest House, the building of 
the Commerce Department, the N.S.S. building, the buildings of the Ancient History
 Culture and Archaeology Department, Political Science Department, Department
 of Oriental Languages, Hindi Bhawan, Psychology department, Education department,
 Geography Department the New Library building are comparatively new constructions.
 Likewise in the Muir College Campus several alterations and additions have been 
made from time to time. Among the new buildings, the buildings of the J.K. 
Institute of Applied Physics, the new Gymnastic Hall, the new Mathematics Department 
are some additions. As the years rolled on, the two campuses began to look small.
 Consequently, the University obtained land from the Cantonment Board to house the
 department of Business Administration, Law Faculty and Gandhi Bhawan, Recently 
the bungalow of the late Dr. Bani Prasad has been purchased.



From the beginning the University has been concerned about women's education. 
It purchased houses for a women's Hostel and College at the cost of Rs. 66,286
 and other buildings adjoining the College. While classes for girls were started
 in the old building, Sarojini Naidu and later Priyadarshini Girls Hostel was 
constructed for the boarders and recently the Shatabdi Girls Hostel has been 
constructed to accommodate many more boarders. Ever since the inception of the
 Muir Central College in 1873, efforts were constantly made to accommodate students
 coming from distant places. Formerly there were two boarding houses, one situated
 in the barrack in Malaka near the jail, where the Swarup Rani Hospital now stands.
 Later this boarding house was shifted to the tiled outhouse of the Lowther Castle,
 where the classes of the College were held. Finally it was shifted to a large 
thatched bungalow near the Bhardwaj Ashram.</p>
